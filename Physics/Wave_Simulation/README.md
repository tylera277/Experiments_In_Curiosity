# An experiment in better understanding the motion of waves as they approach land.

I hypothesized that as waves approach land from the deep sea, the system could be modeled as a system of loosely-connected vertical springs.
And as they approach land, their starting base rises but their resting lengths (no stretch, equlibrium state) get shorter. And that 
the springs earlier on would transfer their energy to them and result in a higher amplitude wave.

But upon further analysis, it has been found that if the characteristics of the springs are not changed, namely the spring constant, that the 
net distance the springs move is equal all across the board.
